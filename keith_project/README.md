## Important notes

I will put the "media" folder in the same folder as the manage.py file, since that's the recommended way of oing it in real life,
even though it goes against this project's instructions (source: 
Nathan Jones's reply on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44548832/media-path-for-app-in-django ). 


There’s simply no easy way of doing this project without putting the “media” folder in the same folder as the manage.py file. I 
know it goes against the rules set by this project. That is, I know that I should put all folder either inside of the “project” 
or the “app” folder. However, it will be impossible for me to make this web app without putting the “media” folder in the same 
folder as manage.py. 

None of the previous projects asked me to use something like the “media” folder since all images had to be taken from an internet 
link (like in the “commerce” project.) 

So, I will have to end up leaving the “media” folder in the same folder as the manage.py file, even if it goes against the rules. 
Also, the instructions say that “in general”, I need to use the same file structure as the previous projects. I will interpret “in
 general” as in “not necessarily exactly the same file structure as the previous projects, but pretty close to it”.
