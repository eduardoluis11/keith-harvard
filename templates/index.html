{% extends "layout.html" %}

<!-- The "extends" snippet will call my layout file, so that I can show the Bootstrap CSS, the footer, and the navbar
in here -->

<!-- I will call the “block body” tag on the index.html file to call the code from the layout file on the index file.

{% block body %}
Hello world
