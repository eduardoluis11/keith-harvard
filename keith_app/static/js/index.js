/* I will use a huge chunk of JS code for the game from a specific tutorial in YouTube (source: Channel A (Alex Ziska)
from https://youtu.be/vyqbNFMDRGQ ).

I will need to create multiple JS files in order for the code to be readable. Remember to put the links to these JS
files on the layout.html file so that I can load those scripts. I will use the same file structure as the one in the
fighting game tutorial from YouTube from Channel A (Alex Ziska). That is, I will create the following 3 files: index.js,
utils.js, and classes.js.
